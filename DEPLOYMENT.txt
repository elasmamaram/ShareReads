# DEPLOYMENT DOCUMENTATION - ShareReads



## 1. How to Run the Project Locally (Offline)

To open and run the project on any computer:

1. Go to our GitHub repository:  
   https://github.com/elasmamaram/ShareReads

2. Click the green *Code* button and choose *Download ZIP*.

3. After downloading, extract (unzip) the folder.

4. Inside the folder, double-click index.html. It will open in your browser.

5. From there, you can:
   - Search books using the search bar
   - View the homepage design
   - Click on the *Login* button to test the admin panel

6. Use this fake login to access the admin page:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin

The admin panel is just for display; it doesn’t connect to a database.

## 2. How to View the Website Online (GitHub Pages)

We also deployed the website using GitHub Pages so it’s accessible online:

*Live Link:*  
https://elasmamaram.github.io/ShareReads/

You don’t need to install anything. Just open the link in your browser and it works.
